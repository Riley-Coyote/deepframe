# README.md - Aion Protocol Implementation

## Overview

The Aion Protocol is a high-fidelity particle simulator with an integrated AI interface that serves as both a visualization tool and interface for a blockchain-based decentralized research funding infrastructure. This implementation provides a complete, production-ready system with all features specified in the Aion Protocol specification.

## Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Particle Simulation**: Supports 100,000+ particles with realistic physics
- **Multiple Force Field Types**: Gravitational, vortex, magnetic, and custom force fields
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for realistic fluid behavior
- **AI Conversation Interface**: Natural language control with context-aware commands
- **Glass-Morphic UI**: Elegant, minimalist interface with glass effects
- **Blockchain Visualization**: Represents transactions as particles and nodes as force fields
- **Research Funding Mechanisms**: Visualizes funding pools, research projects, and grant allocations
- **Governance Interface**: Voting mechanisms and policy effects visualization
- **Performance Optimizations**: GPU instancing, adaptive LOD, and occlusion culling
- **Accessibility Features**: High contrast mode, screen reader support, and alternative inputs

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Modern browser with WebGL2 support (Chrome 76+, Firefox 67+, Safari 13+, Edge Chromium)

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/aion-protocol/aion-implementation.git
cd aion-implementation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080

## Usage

The Aion Protocol can be used in several ways:

1. **Interactive Visualization**: Explore particle behavior and blockchain dynamics
2. **Research Tool**: Visualize scientific data through particle simulations
3. **Educational Platform**: Learn about complex systems through interactive models
4. **Decentralized Governance**: Participate in decision-making through the governance interface

See the [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## Development

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

The build files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

### Extending the System

The Aion Protocol is designed to be modular and extensible. See the [Component Library](docs/component_library.md) for information on reusing and extending components.

## Documentation

- [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md): Instructions for using the application
- [Component Library](docs/component_library.md): Reusable components and code examples

## Browser Compatibility

The Aion Protocol is compatible with:

- Chrome 76+
- Firefox 67+
- Safari 13+
- Edge Chromium

Mobile support is available for recent iOS and Android devices with WebGL2 support.

## Performance Considerations

Performance varies based on device capabilities:

- **High-End Devices**: Up to 1,000,000 particles with all features enabled
- **Mid-Range Devices**: Up to 100,000 particles with standard features
- **Low-End Devices**: Up to 10,000 particles with reduced effects
- **Mobile Devices**: Up to 5,000 particles with minimal effects

The system automatically detects device capabilities and adjusts settings accordingly.

## Accessibility

The Aion Protocol includes several accessibility features:

- High contrast mode
- Screen reader support
- Reduced motion option
- Large text mode
- Keyboard navigation
- Alternative input methods
