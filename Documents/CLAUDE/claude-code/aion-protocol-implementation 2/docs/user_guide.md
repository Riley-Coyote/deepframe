## Using the AI Interface

The AI interface allows you to control the simulation using natural language commands.

### Text Commands

Type your commands in the chat input field. Examples include:
- "Add 10,000 particles"
- "Create a vortex field at the center"
- "Change particle color to blue"
- "Increase simulation speed to 2x"
- "Show me the network statistics"

### Voice Commands

Click the microphone icon to use voice commands:
1. Wait for the "Listening..." indicator
2. Speak your command clearly
3. The AI will process your command and respond

### Command Context

The AI remembers previous commands and simulation state, so you can use contextual references:
- "Make them bigger" (after talking about particles)
- "Move it to the left" (after creating a force field)
- "Increase that by 50%" (referring to a previously mentioned value)

## Simulation Features

### Particle System

The particle system is the core of the Aion Protocol visualization:

- **Particle Count**: Adjust from 1,000 to 1,000,000 particles (device dependent)
- **Particle Size**: Change the visual size of particles
- **Particle Color**: Set colors based on properties or custom values
- **Particle Properties**: Assign mass, charge, and other physical properties

### Force Fields

Force fields influence particle behavior:

- **Gravitational**: Attracts particles based on mass and distance
- **Vortex**: Creates spinning motion around a central point
- **Magnetic**: Affects charged particles
- **Custom**: Define your own force field equations

To create a force field:
1. Right-click (or long press on touch devices) at the desired location
2. Select the force field type from the popup menu
3. Adjust parameters using the sliders

### Fluid Dynamics

The fluid dynamics system simulates liquid-like behavior:

- **Viscosity**: Controls how "thick" the fluid appears
- **Surface Tension**: Affects how particles stick together
- **Pressure**: Influences how particles respond to compression
- **Density**: Determines the spacing between particles

Enable fluid dynamics from the Simulation menu or with the command "enable fluid dynamics".

### Constraint Systems

Constraints connect particles together:

- **Springs**: Elastic connections between particles
- **Distance**: Fixed-length connections
- **Angle**: Controls the angle between connected particles

To create constraints:
1. Select two or more particles
2. Open the Constraints panel
3. Choose the constraint type
4. Adjust parameters as needed

## Aion Protocol Features

### Blockchain Visualization

The blockchain visualization represents:

- **Nodes**: Shown as force fields in the simulation
- **Transactions**: Visualized as particles moving between nodes
- **Consensus**: Represented by particle density and color patterns

Different transaction types are color-coded:
- **Blue**: Standard transfers
- **Green**: Research grants
- **Yellow**: Voting actions
- **Purple**: Research submissions
- **Orange**: Funding allocations

### Research Funding

The research funding visualization shows:

- **Funding Pools**: Large particle clusters with distinct colors
- **Research Projects**: Smaller particle groups connected to funding pools
- **Funding Flow**: Particles moving from sources to projects

To interact with research funding:
1. Select a funding pool or project for details
2. Use the "Fund Project" button to contribute
3. View impact metrics in the project details panel

### Governance Interface

The governance system allows for decentralized decision-making:

- **Proposals**: Represented as force fields with particle accumulation
- **Voting**: Visualized as particles moving toward proposals
- **Policy Effects**: Shown through changes in simulation parameters

To participate in governance:
1. Browse active proposals in the Governance panel
2. Select a proposal to view details
3. Cast your vote using the voting buttons
4. Watch as your vote affects the consensus visualization
